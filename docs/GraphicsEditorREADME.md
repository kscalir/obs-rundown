## Next Steps
1. Add data binding capabilities for dynamic content
2. Create template save/load functionality
3. Implement guide lines and snapping for precise alignment
4. Add OBS WebSocket integration for live graphics
5. Implement text-to-path conversion for export consistency

## Notes
- The editor is being developed as a standalone component for easy integration
- All features are being built to match Loopic.io functionality
- The system is designed to integrate with the existing OBS rundown app
- Current implementation focuses on core editing capabilities before advanced features
- **Font Consistency**: Text will be converted to paths on export to ensure graphics appear identical on any machine regardless of installed fonts. This is critical for broadcast graphics where consistency is paramount.
