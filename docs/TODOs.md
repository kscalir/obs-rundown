# Timeline Refactor TODOs

- [ ] PropertyLanes scaffolding under each item row
- [ ] Transform lanes (x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, opacity)
- [ ] Lane interactions: add / move / delete KFs, snapping (grid/playhead/neighbor)
- [ ] Transform sampling and playback (compose values, call updateElementFromTimeline)
- [ ] "Add Property" picker (per element type) for style lanes
- [ ] Style lanes (text first: fill, stroke, fontSize, letterSpacing, lineHeight, etc.)
- [ ] Color sampling (RGB lerp; future: OKLab), boolean/enum stepped tracks
- [ ] Persist tracksById with propertyTracks; derive combined KFs on write (optional)
- [ ] Easing UI in lane context menu
- [ ] UX polish: tooltips, keyboard nudges, selection state, lane hide/lock
