- Each rundown item stores scene UID and audio automation properties.
- Properties panel supports per-cue transition and automation settings.

## 4. Transitions & Audio Automation [ ]
- Each cue can have its own transition and audio automation.
- Logic for continuous media playback and per-cue automation.

## 8. Workflow Memory & Future-Proofing [ ]
- Commit all workflow and design ideas to memory for future development.
- Ensure context for CRUD, OBS, transitions, automation, OSC/MIDI, and player/source assignment is captured.

## 9. Pending Tasks [ ]
- Implement automatic player/source assignment in cue creation/execution.
- Update UI/data model for media referencing and automation routing.
- Design/implement OSC/MIDI integration with soft takeover/deadband.
- Create visual audio representation UI.
