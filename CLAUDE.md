# OBS Rundown Control System - Session Save

## Date: 2025-08-16

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive live execution control system for OBS Rundown with a broadcast-style control surface featuring both in-page and popup window modes.

## Major Features Completed

### 1. Control Page Live Execution System
- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/ControlPage.jsx`
- Broadcast-style control surface with streamdeck-like button grid
- Real-time rundown execution with LIVE/PREVIEW/NEXT states
- Auto-scroll to keep live item visible at top of rundown
- LED-style status indicators with glow effects

### 2. Manual Block System
- Manual cue blocks with drag-and-drop support
- Dynamic button population when entering manual blocks
- Preview → Program workflow for manual items
- Visual indicators (green background) when in manual mode
- Auto-skip manual blocks during regular NEXT execution

### 3. Control Pad Features
- 8x4 button grid layout
- Adjustable zoom (0.5x to 1.5x scale)
- Responsive sizing that keeps buttons visible
- Square button proportions maintained during scaling
- Button types:
  - Manual item buttons (dynamically populated)
  - Transition buttons (Cut, Fade, Slide, Stinger)
  - STOP button (red when stopped)
  - NEXT button (executes cue progression)

### 4. Popup Control Surface
- **Popup Component**: `/frontend/src/ControlSurfacePage.jsx`
- **Route**: `/control-surface`
- Separate window functionality for undocked operation
- Real-time state sync via localStorage
- Button clicks in popup affect main window
- In-page control surface auto-hides when popup is open

### 5. Item Type Support
- Graphics (PDF/IMAGE display)
- Video playback
- Manual blocks
- Presenter notes (display only, no preview/live)
- Proper type pills in rundown display

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```javascript
executionState = {
  liveItemId: string,
  previewItemId: string,
  nextItemId: string,
  stopped: boolean,
  armedTransition: string,
  armedManualItem: object,
  previewManualItem: object,
  liveManualItem: object,
  currentManualBlockId: string
}
```

### Key Functions
- `executeNext()` - Advances to next item/cue
- `toggleStop()` - Toggles stop state
- `armTransition(type)` - Arms transition override
- `executeManualItem(item)` - Arms manual items
- `handleButtonClick(button, index)` - Unified button handler

### Routing
Simple URL-based routing in `main.jsx`:
- `/` - Main app with full interface
- `/control-surface` - Popup control surface only

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Completed Tasks (102 items)
- All core control surface functionality
- Manual block system
- Popup window support
- Auto-scroll and visual indicators
- Button scaling and responsiveness

### Pending Tasks
1. Create execution_state database table and API endpoints
2. Add WebSocket connection for real-time updates
3. Implement auto-execution logic for timed cues
4. Add timing system for auto-graphics
5. Implement transition override system

## File Structure
```
/frontend/src/
├── components/
│   ├── ControlPage.jsx (main control interface)
│   ├── ManualBlock.jsx (manual cue block component)
│   └── ControlPad.jsx (button grid component)
├── ControlSurfacePage.jsx (popup control surface)
└── main.jsx (routing)
```

## Recent Fixes
1. Fixed React Hooks violations by proper useEffect placement
2. Resolved initialization order issues with function references
3. Fixed button data structure for popup-to-main communication
4. Corrected localStorage sync to avoid infinite re-render loops
5. Ensured popup action handler is defined after handleButtonClick

## Testing Notes
- Popup control surface functional but may need refinement
- Manual blocks working with drag-and-drop
- Auto-scroll keeping live item visible
- Button scaling maintains square proportions
- All transitions and execution logic operational

## UI Guidelines
- **Icons**: Use Bootstrap Icons (`react-bootstrap-icons`) exclusively throughout the application
  - Already installed: `npm install react-bootstrap-icons`
  - Import example: `import { Files, Gear, Play, Stop } from 'react-bootstrap-icons'`
  - Usage: `<Files size={18} />` for consistent sizing
  - Do NOT use emoji characters or other icon libraries

## Commands
- Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
- Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5177/ (port may vary)

## Session Context
This session focused on completing the popup control surface functionality after multiple React-related crashes. The main challenges were:
1. React Hooks rule violations
2. Function initialization order issues  
3. State synchronization between windows
4. Button click handling across popup/main window boundary

All major issues have been resolved and the system is functional.
